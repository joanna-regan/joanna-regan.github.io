<h1> CO2 Emissions Across the Globe </h1>
  <p>
    There is no debate among the scientific community that human-generated emissions of greenhouse gases are exponentially increasing the liklihood of large-scale natural disasters in the very near future due to climate change. Our dependence on fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution has increased the global CO2 emissions to a dangerous level. If we don't take action soon, we may cross an irreversible threshold - if it's not already too late. 

  </b>In this visualization, we examine the levels of CO2 Emissions from 1960 to 2018 among the top 25 countries with the highest levels of emissions, measured in million metric tons. Though perhaps a more fair analysis would consider additional factors such as population, GDP, or renewable resource production, we simply look at the base values. Regardless of our excuses or good intentions, this visualization shows the alarming amount of CO2 polluting our Earth.
    
</b>Data is sourced from The World Bank. Per their defintions: "Carbon dioxide emissions are those stemming from the burning of fossil fuels and the manufacture of cement. They include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and gas flaring."
